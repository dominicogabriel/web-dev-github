Inline Styles : Assign elements styles via the style attributes
Global CSS Style : One CSS rule can apply to multiple elements on the page
CSS Selector : Part of CSS rule that defines for which element(s) the rule applied
Head & Body : Clarifies which content is the main visual content and which data is extra metadata

Meta Information : Information that provides but not visually visible on the website (information that important for the website)
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
This is metadata

<body></body>
Page content

There are two main ways of achieving this:

You can use the special <pre>...</pre> tags (for "preformatted text") - these tags wrap any text (that may include HTML code) and "tell the browser" to output it as plain text (i.e. NOT interpret it as HTML code). When using <pre>, whitespace is also preserved and NOT ignored (as it normally would be)

Alternatively, if you simply want to output the "<" character (e.g. in some math formula that should be shown on your page), you can use some special "shortcuts" (so-called "HTML entities") in your HTML code:

E.g. if you write &gt; in your HTML code, the browser will output the ">" (greater than) symbol

&lt; => "<" (lower than)



Inheritance : Selected container rules apply to descendants
Cascading : Multiple rules can be applied to same elements (The latest applied rules win)
Specificity : More specific selector wins over less specific selector
